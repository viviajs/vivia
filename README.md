vivia is a simple and fast static website generator that gives you more freedom to control everything on your website through powerful plugins.

## Feature
- Only encapsulate the basic components of the website (content, templates, data), simple and fast
- Plugins pipeline, by defining `pipeline` in configuration, each plugin can control the final output, including operations such as adding watermarks to images
- A more natural output, where the structure in `content` is the final website structure
- Theme inheritance, no need to write complex configuration, just inherit the theme directly
